Predicting Credit Risk
Goal: Build a machine learning model that attempts to predict whether a loan will be approved or not.

Background
Lending services companies allow individual investors to partially fund personal loans as well as buy and sell notes backing the loans on a secondary market. This data will be used to create machine learning models to classify the risk level of given loans. I will also compare the Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier.

Provided Data: lending_data.csv

Considerations: Which model will perform better?
